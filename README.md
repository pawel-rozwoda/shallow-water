todo: 
- make sure 1-dimensional solution is correct
- 2-dimensional solution
- load and save liquid mass & Courant number for comparison


already seem to work:
- 1-dimensional solution


conclusions:
- for current results, simulation is unstable for approximately dt < 0.4 or dx < 0.5. Or probably dependant of combination of both.
